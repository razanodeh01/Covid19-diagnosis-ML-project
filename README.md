# " COVID-19 Diagnosis "
<h2>Introduction..</h2>
<p>The main objective of this project was to create software that could accurately diagnose Covid-19 by utilizing available information. The initial phase involved organizing medical data, and then we delved into computer techniques such as decision trees and artificial neural networks (ANN). To assess the performance of the method, specific datasets were used, presented in a standardized tabular format with established metrics. We carefully selected a Python-compatible tool for this purpose, and the effectiveness of the system was tested using different amounts of data or for diagnosing other diseases, which served as an added contribution.</p>

<h2>Algorithms utilized..</h2>
<p> In our effort to predict Covid-19 result, we employed both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Trees.</p>

<h2>Results..</h2>



<h2>Conclusion..</h2>
<p>The observation that increasing the size of the training set leads to more positive results in the testing set suggests that our machine learning models, particularly the Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers, benefit from a larger and more diverse set of training examples. A larger training set allows the models to better generalize patterns and relationships within the data, potentially improving their ability to accurately predict COVID-19 outcomes. This finding underscores the importance of robust training data in enhancing the performance and reliability of our predictive models, reinforcing our commitment to obtaining and utilizing comprehensive datasets for more effective COVID-19 analysis and prediction within our project.</p>
